            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p> My parents are from China but came to Canada for jobs/post-doctoral work where I was born, and although I think I still have a Canadian citizenship I moved either a day before or after I turned a year old. Needless to say I don't exactly consider
                myself Canadian and remember almost nothing from Canada. After that I spent 8 years in Oregon, until about a third of the way through 3rd grade. After that I've spent the rest of my life in California. </p>

            <p> Most recently I went to Goleta for a year to serve as a full-time ministry intern for a church on the UCSB campus. The church was only in its second year so there was a lot of work to do to build it up (from mentoring to being an audio engineer
                to cooking), but it was a also a privilege to see a church growing in its younger years and to be a part of establishing the culture there and seeing the students, Christian and non-Christian alike, grow in their understanding and appreciation
                of Christianity. And now I'm looking forward to starting this bootcamp with you guys and hope to learn a lot in my time here! </p>

            <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
            <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/539a792de4b04d13b7ae737a/57c48962ff7c500b946564e3/57c48963ff7c500b946564e4/1472498046072/20160824-igsm-sf-outing_29248346886_o.jpg?format=750w" alt="International Graduate Student Ministry Light Painting"/>
            <p> I just moved back to Berkeley from Goleta two months ago, and now in my spare time I volunteer as a campus minister to graduate students and international students on the UC Berkeley campus, a little different from the undergraduates I was
                with at UCSB, trying to teach them about Christianity. In my work as a campus minister I've interacted with students from Peru, Nigeria, China, Japan, Korea, India, and several others. Personally I became Christian through a campus ministry
                group my freshmen year in college and it's changed my life in tremendous ways (positively) so being able to volunteer as a campus minister and share the same things I learned in college (outside of my classes) with students from all over
                the world (although most of them are from China) has been a tremendous privilege. </p>

            <p> If you have any questions about Christianity or feel like talking about religion in general I'm totally down to dialogue with you. Exploring other people's beliefs and being able to share my own beliefs with them is one of my greatest joys
                in life and I think one of the best parts of being in an area as diverse as the Bay Area is the diversity of worldviews that's present here.

            <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I like to tell myself that one of my hobbies is playing tennis because it makes me sound more active than I really am. I played a lot in high school but after that I only pick up a racket a couple of times a year. </li>

                <li>I like to cook a lot. It started with me trying to save money and keep myself alive my sophomore year in college, and some of the things I tried turned out rather well so I kept doing it (although some of the things were rather horrendous).
                    I moved into a new apartment recently and my greatest regret is that I can't have a grill or smoker. Now I'm stuck trying to replicate smoked meat using liquid smoke.

                <li>Kind of related to the cooking thing, but I've been trying to grow a sourdough starter recently (which basically means I'm trying to collect yeast and bacteria from the air into a jar so I can make bread with it). </li>
