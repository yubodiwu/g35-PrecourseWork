                <h2>What I want to do</h2>
                <p> To be honest, part of the reason I'm here is because I had a hard time finding a job to do with my major (Civil Engineering), and another reason is because after talking with the people who have managed to find jobs in my major and it
                    doesn't really seem like soemthing that I want to do. I also took a couple of programming classes in college and happened to like them a decent amount so this seemed like the next logical step if I wanted to pursue down that path.
                    Computer applications fascinate me and really I'd be down to work for any software company that's not morally compromising. I'd love if I could work for a company related to my hobbies *cough* <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com">Serious Eats</a>                    *cough* but we'll see if that works out.</p>

                <p> Looking forward to working with y'all! </p>
